# uBoy

An attempt at creating a small Game Boy emulator in C.

## Compiling from source
To build the project, make sure you have CMake 2.8 or higher installed. Create a build folder and execute the following commands from there.

```
user@system:/uBoy/build$ cmake ..
```
This will create a makefile that can then be called by executing ```make``` in the same folder.
