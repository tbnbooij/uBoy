u\+Boy (\char`\"{}micro\+Boy\char`\"{}) is an attempt at creating a small Game Boy emulator in C.

\subsection*{Compiling from source}

To build the project, make sure you have C\+Make 3.\+5 or higher installed. Create a build folder and execute the following commands from there.


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ cmake ..
\end{DoxyCode}
 This will create a makefile that can then be called by executing {\ttfamily make} in the same folder.

\subsection*{Running the program}

After compiling, the program can be started by adding a path to a Game Boy compatible R\+OM in .gb format. Due to legal reasons, these R\+O\+MS are not distributed through this repository.


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ ./uBoy ../ROM/tetris.gb
\end{DoxyCode}
